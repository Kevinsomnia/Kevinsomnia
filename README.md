### Welcome!

I like programming, video games, and music (mostly EDM). I graduated from the University of Michigan's Class of 2020, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer at [Spatial](https://spatial.io).

I'm developing a survival game with a [group of friends](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMX2MEOcHGa_l7msGQ3Img) in my free time.
